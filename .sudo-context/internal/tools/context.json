    "description": "Tool dependencies manager for development tools using the Go 1.18+ tools pattern with build constraints.",
    "purpose": "Manages development tool versions (golangci-lint, gofumpt) by tracking them in go.mod through a dedicated package. This approach ensures reproducible tool versions across the project and prevents tool dependencies from polluting the main module. Tools are installed via the Makefile using GOBIN to keep the project clean.",
    "strengths": [
      "Follows Go community best practices for tool version management",
      "Uses //go:build tools tag to isolate tool imports from production code",
      "Tool versions are pinned in go.mod alongside other dependencies",
      "Clean integration with Makefile for consistent installation across environments"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Tools package itself has no tests (not typically testable by design)",
      "Tool versions are only discoverable by reading go.mod, not self-documenting",
      "Requires manual Makefile updates if new tools are added"
    ],
    "test_coverage": "Not applicable - this package contains only blank imports under build constraints and is not directly testable. Tool validation occurs via Makefile lint and fmt targets which invoke the installed tools.",
    "dependencies": "External: github.com/golangci/golangci-lint/v2 (v2.9.0), mvdan.cc/gofumpt (v0.9.2). No internal dependencies.",
    "functionality": "Provides single-source-of-truth for development tool versions. Enables reproducible build and lint workflows by ensuring all developers use identical tool versions. Supports: static analysis via golangci-lint, code formatting via gofumpt.",
    "files": "| File | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| tools.go | Declares tool imports with //go:build tools tag to pin golangci-lint and gofumpt versions in go.mod |"
