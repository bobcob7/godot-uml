    "description": "Container package that houses all diagram rendering implementations, currently providing SVG output format.",
    "purpose": "The renderer package serves as the architectural layer responsible for converting parsed diagram AST objects into renderable output formats. It acts as the bridge between the parser/AST layer and output generation, organizing renderer implementations (SVG, and potentially others in the future) as independent subpackages. This maintains separation of concerns by keeping rendering logic isolated from parsing and validation.",
    "strengths": [
      "Extensible architecture: Organized as a container for multiple renderer implementations (svg, and future formats like PNG, PDF)",
      "Clear separation: Rendering logic isolated from parsing, validation, and AST definitions",
      "Modular subpackages: Each renderer format (svg) is self-contained with independent interfaces and implementations",
      "Single responsibility: Package focuses exclusively on output generation, not diagram analysis"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "No shared interfaces: Container structure doesn't define a common Renderer interface across implementations",
      "No renderer factory: No centralized way to select and instantiate renderers by format",
      "Currently single implementation: Only SVG renderer exists; no demonstration of true extensibility yet",
      "Documentation: No top-level documentation or example of renderer interface contracts"
    ],
    "test_coverage": "Test coverage is provided at the svg subpackage level. All 40+ tests for ClassRenderer and SequenceRenderer implementations are located in internal/renderer/svg/{class_test.go, sequence_test.go}. No container-level tests exist as there is no code at the top level.",
    "dependencies": "No direct dependencies at the container level. Subpackages (svg) depend on: internal/ast (AST definitions), internal/font (text measurement), internal/layout (graph layout), internal/theme (styling). The container package itself has no imports or external dependencies.",
    "functionality": "Serves as a namespace and organizational boundary for diagram rendering implementations. Provides access to renderer subpackages through the internal/renderer import path. Future versions will add support for additional output formats (PNG, PDF, etc.) as separate subpackages within this container.",
    "files": "No files exist at the top level of internal/renderer. The directory contains only the svg subdirectory which houses the complete SVG rendering implementation (ClassRenderer, SequenceRenderer, and tests)."
