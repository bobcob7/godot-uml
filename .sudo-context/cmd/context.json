    "description": "Container directory for command-line application entry points.",
    "purpose": "Organizes executable entry points for the godot-uml project. Currently contains the go-uml CLI application which provides a command-line interface for rendering, validating, and serving PlantUML diagrams. Follows Go project convention of separating CLI tooling from library code.",
    "strengths": [
      "Clear separation of concerns between library (pkg, internal) and executables (cmd)",
      "Scalable structure for adding additional CLI tools or applications",
      "Houses the main entry point for the primary godot-uml command-line tool"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Currently contains only one subdirectory (go-uml), minimal organizational value at present",
      "May be underutilized if additional CLI tools are not planned"
    ],
    "test_coverage": "No direct tests at cmd level; testing is handled at cmd/go-uml level which includes comprehensive unit and integration tests.",
    "dependencies": "Internal: Depends on cmd/go-uml which in turn depends on pkg/gouml (rendering engine) and internal/server (HTTP server). External: Standard library for CLI execution.",
    "functionality": "Serves as the container for all executable entry points. The go-uml application within provides four main commands: render (PlantUML to SVG), validate (syntax checking), serve (interactive HTTP editor), and version (build information).",
    "files": "No files at top level. Contains subdirectory: cmd/go-uml (CLI application with main.go and main_test.go)."
