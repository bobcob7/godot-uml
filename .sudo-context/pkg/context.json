  "sections": {
    "description": "Container directory holding public library packages for the godot-uml project.",
    "purpose": "Organizes and exposes public-facing Go packages that external projects can import and use. Currently contains the `gouml` package which provides the main user-facing API for rendering PlantUML diagrams to SVG. Follows Go project layout conventions by keeping public packages under `pkg/` to signal they are part of the stable, exported API surface.",
    "strengths": [
      "Clean separation between internal implementation and public API",
      "Follows Go project layout best practices with `pkg/` directory convention",
      "Single well-designed public package (gouml) with comprehensive functionality",
      "Easy to extend with additional public packages as the project grows",
      "Clear contract for consumers \u2014 anything in `pkg/` is stable and documented"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Currently only contains one subdirectory (gouml), making the container somewhat minimal",
      "No shared utilities or base types across multiple public packages yet",
      "No version management or backward compatibility strategy documented at the container level"
    ],
    "test_coverage": "No direct test coverage at the container level. All testing is performed in subdirectories (gouml_test.go handles the public API tests). The test suite validates all exported functions, options, and error handling as a whole.",
    "dependencies": "Internal: github.com/bobcob7/godot-uml/pkg/gouml (re-exports the public API). External: None at container level (dependencies are managed by individual packages).",
    "functionality": "Serves as the public API namespace for godot-uml, housing the gouml package which provides diagram rendering, parsing, validation, and customization capabilities. Provides a stable, documented interface for importing and using godot-uml in other Go projects.",
    "files": "No top-level files in this directory. Contains only the `gouml/` subdirectory which holds the main public API package."
