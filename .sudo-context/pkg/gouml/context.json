    "description": "Public library API for rendering PlantUML diagrams to SVG format.",
    "purpose": "Provides a clean, user-facing interface for parsing and rendering PlantUML diagrams in Go applications. Acts as the primary entry point for the godot-uml project, exposing high-level functions like Render, Parse, and Validate while abstracting internal implementation details. Supports both class and sequence diagrams with customizable theme and skinparam options.",
    "strengths": [
      "Clean public API with minimal surface area (Render, Parse, Validate, RenderDiagram functions)",
      "Comprehensive error handling with line/column position information",
      "Flexible option pattern for theme customization and skinparam overrides",
      "Automatic diagram type detection (class vs sequence) for correct renderer selection",
      "Error recovery allows parsing to continue and report multiple issues",
      "Well-tested with 100% test coverage across main use cases"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Error handling returns first error from Render() rather than all errors",
      "Limited input validation before parser invocation",
      "No logging support for debugging render issues",
      "Opaque Diagram type requires users to parse first before rendering separately"
    ],
    "test_coverage": "Comprehensive test coverage via gouml_test.go using table-driven subtests. Tests include: Render happy path (class/sequence/empty diagrams), WithSkinparam customization, WithTheme customization, invalid input handling, read errors, Parse validation, RenderDiagram with type detection, Validate standalone usage. All tests use t.Parallel() and assert patterns from testify.",
    "dependencies": "Internal: github.com/bobcob7/go-uml/internal/ast, /internal/parser, /internal/renderer/svg, /internal/theme. External: github.com/stretchr/testify (testing only)",
    "functionality": "Exposes 4 main functions and 2 option constructors: Render(io.Reader, io.Writer, ...Option) reads PlantUML and writes SVG; RenderDiagram(io.Writer, *Diagram, ...Option) renders pre-parsed diagrams; Parse(io.Reader) parses to AST; Validate(io.Reader) validates without rendering; WithTheme(*theme.Theme) sets custom theme; WithSkinparam(string, string) overrides individual properties. Returns *Error type with line/column information for error reporting.",
